- Add GPIB address to libgpib:conn as paramenter
- Change key naming (see load + psu wiki pages)
- Provied SR_DF_META packets for the Re:load Pro and the HP3478A for changed values/states (e.g. output switched on/off, ovp, otp, ...)
- Re:load Pro: when acquisition is running and we send a command (e.g. "set xxx"), there are 2 listeners (1st send_cmd() (<-serial_write_blocking) and 2nd handle_new_data() (<-serial_read_nonblocking))
- Re:load Pro: when 2 responses are send fast afer each other, serial_read_nonblocking reads them both and the \r\n gets in beetween
- Re:load Pro: sometimes only a ^M is send from the rlp
- Re:load Pro: Sometimes the responses are mixed up (2 listeners??, Re:load Pro not keeping up??)
- Re:load Pro: how to clear otp_active and uvc_active?

Done

- Re:load Pro: send "monitor 0" when device is scaned to stop eventually running monitoring and version can be read properly
- Re:load Pro: send "monitor 0" when device is closed

- Link API to the psu and load wiki pages


Re:load Pro Firmware
====================

- Add "output" command (returns "on" / "off") to determin in wich state the output is (git commit 448cf71, 558bc0e (part))
- Send "on" / "off" when output state was changed at the device directly
- Send "uvlo xxx" when undervoltage threshold was changed at the device directly (git commit 224ab62)
