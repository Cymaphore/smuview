== Overview

SmuView is a graphical frontend for the libsigrok library, permitting access to
a wide range of devices to let you record, analyze, process and export analog
data. It is part of the sigrok suite, just like the libraries that it makes use
of.

The sigrok suite needs some kind of hardware to interface to the signals you
want to examine or control. SmuView currently supports devices that can either
work as a https://sigrok.org/wiki/Supported_hardware#Power_supplies[power supply]
or an https://sigrok.org/wiki/Supported_hardware#Digital_loads[electronic load].
Both of these device types are most of the time controllable. There is also a
large number of measurement devices that are supported by SmuView like

The SmuView user interface is geared towards controlling devices and analysis of
captured data. From here, you can access all features.

Before we dive deeper into how to accomplish things, let's make SmuView
available on your system first.
