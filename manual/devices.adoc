== Devices

SmuView supports a wide variety of analog devices. Because of that, some of the
following terms may have a slightly different meaning for different device
types.

A device can contain the following objects:

Channel group image:icons/document-open-folder.png[width=18,Height=18]::
A device can have no, one or more channel groups. Channel groups normally
corresponds to a physical channel on the device itself.
+
A three output channel power supplies for example will have three channel
groups, probably named `1`, `2` and `3`.
+
A multimeter normally doesn't have a channel group.

Channel image:icons/office-chart-area.png[width=18,Height=18]::
A device can have multiple channels. Channels can be in a channel group or
belong to the device itself.
+
A power supply normally has a voltage and a current channel per channel group.
+
A multimeter probably has one channel for the main display and maybe one for a
secondary display.

Signal image:icons/office-chart-line.png[width=18,Height=18]::
A channel can contain one or more signals. A signal represents the samples
generated by the device.
+
Channels of power supplies, electronic loads and math channels always contain
only one signal with a fixed quantity and unit.
+
Channels of multimeters may contain multiple signals, each one with a unique
qunatity, quantity flags and unit.

Contollable image:icons/mixer-front.png[width=18,Height=18]::
A device can have no, one or more controllables. Up to one controllable can
belong to a channel group or to the device itself.
+
A power supplies channel group controllable can probably control the output
voltage and current, enable OVP and OCP and enable the output  .

[[config_key]]
Config key image:icons/configure.png[width=18,Height=18]::
A controllable contains one or more config keys. A config key controls a single
property of the device like the sink current of an electronic load or enables
the output of a power supply channel group. It may be read- and writeable.

This is the start screen, when you start SmuView without any
<<cli,command line parameters>>:

image:numbers/1.png[1,22,22] Connect a new hardware device. +
image:numbers/2.png[2,22,22] Create a new <<user_device,user device>>. +
image:numbers/3.png[3,22,22] Disconnect and close the selected device. All
acquired data will be lost!

When you connect a device, you will get the following functions:

image:numbers/1.png[1,22,22] Start/Stop data acquisition for this device. +

=== Measurement device

A measurement device can be everything from a multimeter over a thermometer to
a scale.

Most of the measurement devices are not controllable and have no channel groups.

=== Power supply

Most of the supported  power supplies are controllable and have one or more
channel group with a voltage channel and a current channel. Some power supplies
may have additional channels like for power or frequency. The channels contain
only one signal with a fixed quantity and unit.

Math channels for power, resistance, Wh and Ah are automatically generated if
not provided by the device.

=== Electronic load

All of the supported loads are controllable and have one channel group with a
voltage channel and a current channel. Some loads may have additional channels
like for power or Ah. The channels contain only one signal with a fixed quantity
and unit.

Math channels for power, resistance, Wh and Ah are automatically generated if
not provided by the device.

=== Oscilloscope

Oscilloscopes aren't supported yet, but will be in the future!

Oscilloscopes have a channel group for each scope channel and one channel per
channel group with a signal for each captured frame. The controllable for a
channel group is responsible for the vertical settings of the correspondig scope
channel. The controllable for the device itself controls the timebase, the
trigger settings and so on.

[[user_device]]
=== User device

A user devices has no hardware device attached to it and is basically a virtual
device. It may contain math channels or visualisation and control views from
other devices to build a custom GUI.
