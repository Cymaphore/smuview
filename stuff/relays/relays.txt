55.34.9.012.5040 (AgNi + Au plated)
55.34.9.006.0040 (AgNi)


A 7A medium power relay with AgNi contacts has a minimum switching specification of 5 V / 5 mA / 300 mW.
This relay is also available with gold plated contacts; when the revised values become 5 V / 2 mA / 50 mW.

If a much lower voltage must be reliably switched, consider two contacts in parallel. This dramatically
lowers the minimum switching load - two parallel gold contacts make it possible to handle loads down to
0.1 V / 1 mA / 1 mW. It may be useful to appreciate that statistically the unreliability of two contacts
in parallel is equal to the unreliability of the single contact raised to the power of two. So, just to
illustrate the maths, a 1% unreliable switching circuit becomes 0.01% unreliable - i.e. a 100x improvement
in reliability. And for three contacts in parallel the unreliability would be raised to the power of
three â€“ a 10,000x improvement in reliability!

Minimum switching load:
The minimum values of power, voltage and current that a contact can reliably switch. For example, if
minimum values are 300 mW, 5 V / 5 mA:
- with 5 V the current must be at least 60 mA;
- with 24 V the current must be at least 12.5 mA;
- with 5 mA the voltage must be at least 60 V;
For gold contact variants, loads no less than 50 mW, 5 V / 2 mA are suggested.
With 2 gold contacts in parallel, it is possible to switch 1 mW, 0.1 V / 1 mA.
