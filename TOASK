- why are packets of arachnid-labs-re-load-pro (edl), maynuo-m97 (edl) and
	baylibre-acme (thermometer, powermeter) surrounded by SR_DF_FRAME_BEGIN +
	SR_DF_FRAME_END. All other drivers containing frames are oscilloscopes.
	That makes total sense for the oscilloscopes, but for the electronic loads,
	that doesn't make any sense to me.
	Can't say anything about the baylibre-acme.
